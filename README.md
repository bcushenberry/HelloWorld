# Overview

This program is meant to serve as proof that my development environment is up and running without issues.
It does this by displaying "Hello World!" to the console using the "print" function in Python.

I chose to write the program in Python as a means of giving myself a quick refresher in the language.
I also included color tags because I had forgotten how to use them and wanted to remember.

A demonstration of this program can be found at the link below:

# Development Environment

The tools used to develop and publish this program were:
1. VS Code - Microsoft's coding tool. This was used to write and run the code.
2. Git and Github - A version control system and developer platform, respectively. These were used to upload and host the code on the internet.
  
The language used to write this program was Python. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language. It used for many applications and often even to prototype projects, as it is very quick and easy to work in.
